# CitiesSkylinesStarter

After Paradox released an update to Cities Skylines in January 2020 and added a launcher I was unable to use Remote Play (In-home streaming) to play the game. All I would see is a black screen.

My solution was to write a program that is started via Steam, and then in turn starts Cities Skylines.

# How to set up the Cities Skylines Starter

1. Download the program from here: INSERT LINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2. Place the folder containing CitiesSkylinesStarter on the computer you will be streaming Cities Skylines from
3. Open Steam
4. Click "Add a game"
5. Click "Add a non-Steam game"
6. Click "Browse..."
7. Select CitiesSkylinesStart.exe
8. Find CitiesSkylinesStart, right click it, click "Properties", click "Set launch options"
6. This is important!: You will need to set 3 parameters and can also set 2 optional parameters

[1] Your screen's horizontal resolution e.g. 1920
[2] Your screen's vertical resolution e.g. 1080
  [3] The path to Cities.exe e.g. C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines
  [4] (Optional) Horizontal offset
  [5] (Optional) Vertical offset
